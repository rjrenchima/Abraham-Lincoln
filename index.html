        <p>Abraham Licoln was an American lawyer, politician, and statesman who served as the 16th president of the United States from
            1861 until his assassination in 1865. Lincoln led the Union through the American Civil War to defend the
            nation as a constitutional union and succeeded in defeating the insurgent Confederacy, abolishing slavery,
            bolstering the federal government, and modernizing the U.S. economy.</p>
